        Marquet is one of the continents on the world of Exandria, located south of Issylra and southwest of Tal'Dorei. It is where Campaign Three started, and it is one of the settings of the 
        upcoming adventure module Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep. The adjectival form denoting things and people from Marquet is "Marquesian".

          Geography
        </h1>
        <br>
        </div>
      <p>
        Centuries after the Calamity, Marquet is known as a continent of deserts and mountains, with few bastions of civilization to be found. But only one-third of the continent is desert. There is 
        some in-stream disagreement on the shape of the continent. A paper map shown on-screen shows an outline that does not match a previous description of Marquet as a U-shaped continent.The port 
        city of Shammel is located among the beaches of the Bay of Gifts on the northeastern end of the continent. Beyond that is the Aggrad Mountains, which stretch hundreds of miles before reaching 
        the immense Rumedam Desert, also known as the Marquesian Desert. The city of Ank'Harel, an imperial capital surrounded by a web of smaller villages, is alternately described as being near 
        the center of the Rumedam Desert, or only a day-and-a-half's foot travel from the Aggrad Mountains, making it close to the northern shore relative to most of the continent. To the far 
        south are scrubland and marshes leading to the volatile mountains surrounding the Suuthan Volcano. A separate and distinctive mountain formation, the spire-like Smouldercrown Mountains, 
        can be found 290 miles southeast of Ank'Harel. The desert is at least partly bordered by jungles; on the west coast of Marquet is a village surrounded by tropical greenery. The Rumedam 
        has a sister desert, the Panagrip Sands. To the south are the Gloomed Jungles of Aeshanadoor, home to an erudite orcish society called Yios. The Hellcatch Valley is near the center of 
        Marquet, and despite its dusty, badlands terrain it is home to a number of independent cities and villages. To the southwest are the spire-like peaks, plateaus, and fertile valleys of 
        the Taloned Highlands, governed by the Stratos Throne from the region's heights. To the northwest of the Hellcatch Valley are the Serpentwind Peaks, and within that range is the jungle 
        valley of the Oderan Wilds.Shumas is a region in Marquet. It's unclear what relation this has to the Vault of Shumas, a hidden temple in the Aggrad Mountains that belonged to 
        one religion from the beginning of the Age of Arcanum until just before the Calamity, when it was brutally taken over by another religion's adherents.

          Demographics
        </h1>
      <p>
        Individuals native to or descended from Marquet tend to have darker hair and skin than those from more northerly climes. Many desert elves emigrated from Marquet to the Menagerie Coast 
        following the banishment of Uk'otoa. Only small numbers of dwarves from Marquet visit the Menagerie Coast as travelers or sailors, but one of the dwarves on Rumblecusp, Alana, 
        hailed from Marquet. When Vox Machina visited Ank'Harel, it was mostly populated by humans; they saw only one elf, and saw no dwarves or goliaths, but they did see dark-skinned halflings, 
        a few half-elves, some half-orcs, and a couple of tieflings. Tiefling entertainers from the Menagerie Coast sometimes tour Marquet. People of many races commingle in Jrusar: pachydan, 
        katari, halfling, goliath, elf, orc, gnome, genasi, eisfuura, and more. A young half-elf/half-orc, Anni Aughta, is a performer in the city. The Duneburrow goblins are known to inhabit the 
        deserts and frightening stories about them are told on the Menagerie Coast.

        <b>Politics</b>
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        Ank'Harel<br>
        The central city of Ank'Harel, ruled by J'mon Sa Ord, is in the center of the Rumedam Desert. Numerous small oasis townships surround it,[39] including Shandal, hometown of Shaun Gilmore. 
        It is unclear whether J'mon's rule reaches as far northeast as the city of Shammel.<br>
        Aeshanadoor<br>
        The wilderness jungle of Aeshanadoor in the south is the home of the orcish society of Yios, the peak of collegiate study and social influence. It is ruled by the Court of the Lambent Path.<br>
        Taloned Highlands<br>
        In the southwest, the Taloned Highlands' towering mountains hold elevated valleys, shelves, and plateaus with room for agriculture. The military might of the region is held by the Stratos Throne.<br>
        Hellcatch Valley<br>
        In the center of the continent is the roadway nexus known as the Hellcatch Valley, a rugged badlands of harsh, dusty canyons. It holds numerous independent villages and cities competing for 
        dominance, with no central government.<br>
        Oderan Wilds<br>
        To the northwest, the lush jungle of the Oderan Wilds is home to many towns and villages along the Honored Trails. Its capital is the five-spired city of Jrusar, home of the Chandei 
        Quorum which rules the region.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1 class="sub-title">
          Culture
        </h1>
      <p>
        The Marquesian language is spoken by many humanoids on the continent; it is the main language spoken in the trade and tourism hub of Shammel Bay, but a majority also speak Common with varying 
        proficiency.[44] Marquesian became the language of the Clovis Concord elite and of the pirates of the Revelry due to Marquesian people settling in the Menagerie Coast. Merchants of import, 
        such as those present for the Harvest Close Festival Victory Pit tournament in Zadash, wore outfits consisting of very light linens of a dull egg-shell white, with trims of gold and purple, 
        paired with deep blue pants.Gambit of Ord is a Marquesian card game. An antiwar folk song from Marquet, Let the Sword Grow Rust, is a code-song used by the Golden Grin. An example of a weapon 
        with a Marquesian flair is a Scimitar of Speed, a finely crafted sword with pearlescent gems embedded in the hilt. Sandkheg's Hide is a potent alcoholic beverage produced using the acidic
        bile or spittle of sandkhegs, who are endemic to the Rumedam Desert.

          History
        </h1>
      <p>
        During the Age of Arcanum, Marquet was the lush home of a prominent civilization. During the early years of the Calamity, warring nations on the continent turned the verdant landscape into 
        ash and desert, and during the Calamity a vengeful god was responsible for the creation of the Rumedam Desert and the mountain ranges that separate the regions of the continent.Three to 
        four centuries after the Divergence, Marquesian explorers and traders had a seminal influence on other continents. Over on Tal'Dorei, a legendary spicemonger from Marquet named Abdar helped 
        to fund the construction of Emon in the fourth or maybe fifth century PD, and a major district of the city still bears his name. Around 400 PD, an exploration vessel from Marquet reached 
        the Swavain Islands and first established trade with the Ki'Nau. The Marquesians soon returned and established a colonial outpost called Damali on the Menagerie Coast, the beginning of what 
        would eventually expand into the independent Clovis Concord. A secret sect of Marquesian worshipers of Zehir brought about the banishment of Uk'otoa, who had been a guardian of the Ki'Nau, 
        and an influx of Marquesian travelers to the Menagerie Coast soon followed, including elves who helped found Gwardan. At that time in the fifth century PD, the great city of Ank'Harel had 
        just been founded under the rule of J'mon Sa Ord. When J'mon Sa Ord was declared emperor in Ank'Harel, the Marquesian colonists of the Menagerie Coast demanded independence, and the 
        emperor eventually granted it. At the time, the red dragon Thordak tyrannically ruled over half of Marquet[56] from his base in the Scaldwind Sands. Thordak, with his feral armies 
        of kobolds and other serpentine followers, attacked the city when it was perhaps 100 or 150 years old,[59] but after a two-week battle, his armies were defeated and Thordak was wounded, 
        and as he fled north over the ocean he was struck down and fell into the sea. He was presumed dead for nearly two centuries before his confrontation with Emon's forces in 794 or 795 PD.
