        Tal'Dorei is the name used by humans to refer to the entire continent on Exandria in which the Republic of Tal'Dorei rests, though this is purely a human conflation.
        The Elvish name for the continent is Gwessar, meaning "Fields of Joy".

          Before and during the Founding

      <p>
        Before the gods arrived in the world, a Primordial titan seed was planted in the area that, under its influence, would later become the Rifenmist Jungle.
        During the war between the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods, the Prime Deities imprisoned Tharizdun beneath Gatshadow Mountain. Soon afterward, 
        after the founding of Vasselheim, the mortal races ventured out to discover new lands. In western Gwessar the elves felled the Molten Titan, 
        giving birth to the Daggerbay Mountains. An unknown civilization settled in the area that became the Ivyheart Thicket.
        A noble race called the Kuul'tevir, created in the image of the first dragons and led by a "god-empress," built cities of power comparable to those of the elves, 
        and the seat of their great empire in the southern part of Gwessar was Vos'sykriss. Arriving through a portal from the Far Realm, aboleths and other aberrations 
        meanwhile conquered the Underdark beneath the Bladeshimmer Coast and drove their slaves to build their capital: Salar, the Unseeable City. They slowly began expanding 
        toward the surface, and their psychic energies gradually produced the azuremite of the Crystalfen Caverns. The underground city of Yug'Voril was also established during this era.

          Age of Arcanum
        </h1>
      <p>
        After the Founding gave way to the Age of Arcanum, some among the mortal races continued migrating to the continent that would later be called Tal'Dorei; some rock gnomes traveled 
        over in this era. The first tieflings, having been created in Issylra during the Age of Arcanum, fled from religious zealots and sailed to the continent.Acek Orattim, priest of Tharizdun, 
        made his base in Gatshadow Mountain, under which Tharizdun had been imprisoned. Through Acek, Tharizdun's power twisted and elevated the mountain, riddled it with a maze of tunnels, 
        and corrupted the surrounding region.During the Age of Arcanum, the Kuul'tevir society deteriorated as they turned to violence and lost much of their knowledge of magic. 
        The serpentfolk empire's seers had visions of the the Calamity's vast destruction, and the serpents sought a way to survive it; they built a magical field of perfect stasis beneath 
        Vos'sykriss and chose their most powerful to slumber until the danger had passed, then emerge and rebuild their empire. Possibly contemporary with the Kuul'tevir—and in apparently 
        overlapping territory, in the Rifenmist Jungle—was an ancient civilization called the Qoniira Tetrarchy. Their culture rose long before the Calaimtiy and fell either prior to or 
        during the Calamity, and was ancient even to other ancient civilizations of Exandria.

      <p>
        <b>Possibly before or after the Calamity began</b>
      </p>
        <br>
      <p>
        During one celestial solstice about 900 or 1000 years before the Campaign of Vox Machina—possibly before or shortly after the Calamity began—huge elemental rifts burst open across Exandria, 
        causing terrible earthquakes, fires, and a flood of elemental monsters against which the peoples of the world struggled to defend. Though they eventually beat back the elementals, 
        they were terrified of what would happen on the next solstice. The druidic Ashari, until then a single nomadic society on Gwessar, made a covenant to split into four tribes to seal 
        the rifts and watch over the major remaining portals, where they settled. Two of these rifts were on the continent: the Air Ashari settled at Zephrah, and the Earth Ashari settled at Terrah.

          Calamity
        </h1>
      <p>
        One of the first casualties of the Calamity was Lolth. Her suddenly leaderless drow followers fled from the surface world to rebuild their empire underground; in Gwessar they found themselves 
        surrounded by aberrations, the eventual seat of their power would be Ruhn-Shak, and their leaders began hearing the whispers of Tharizdun.During the Calamity, the cities of the Kuul'tevir 
        were reduced to rubble, and those who perished in Vos'sykriss began to haunt the city as ghosts. The dwarven kingdom of Uthtor was likewise destroyed. A wandering colony of elves 
        fleeing the Calamity formed the beginning of what would become the Orroyen tribes of the Rifenmist Peninsula. In the northeastern reaches of the continent, Ioun baited Tharizdun to her 
        central temple, resulting in her near-destruction. Pelor's subsequent vengeful battle with Tharizdun was so violent, it created the valley where the Parchwood Timberlands stand and 
        raised the Alabaster Sierras. Badly defeated and wounded, Tharizdun retreated to Acek Orattim's realm, but Pelor chased and banished Tharizdun there, beneath Gatshadow. Whether 
        it was in that battle or another, the land bridge connecting Gwessar and Wildemount was shattered, creating the Shearing Channel. In the far south of Gwessar, in one of the final 
        battles of the Calamity, Bane and his goblinkin armies waged the last of their many battles with Melora and her Free Children. After a tremendous battle that permanently reduced the area 
        to sterile ash, Bane was defeated and banished, the gigantic suit of pitted iron armor he wore fell to the ground, and the surviving goblinkin were scattered. This area would become known 
        as the Beynsfal Plateaus. The final battle of the Calamity, in far-off Wildemount, sent shockwaves through Exandria and unintentionally collapsed much of the underground cavern network 
        of Gwessar, bringing about the fall of the aboleth civilization there.
