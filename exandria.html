        The world began when the Gods found the world and created "The First
        Children" or elves.Then following the evles came the dwavers then
        Humans. The land was rough and treacherous many died and this pained the
        Gods.In and atempt to aid them the Gods gave them gifts, these being the
        first magic users. The Gods began to see progress but knew the people
        needed protection. From this came the first protectors: The Dragons
        Matalic of Exandria. The land fought back, seas rose, fires quacked, and
        the land beckoned for the Gods children to join with the primodrials.
        The Primodials being, aunknown to the creators, ancient beings who
        already claimed this world as thier own. These great elemental titans
        reind terror upon the gods children. Fear and pain replaced thier once
        joy filled lives. Broken rocks were flung and formless terrors began to
        devor the children. Demonic entities spilled from the abyss to feast on
        hte left over canage.Some of the Gods were deeply frustrated and angered
        and wished to leave while and start anew while others where filled with
        grief and pain, this created a divied amongst the creators. Thoes of the
        creators that wished to stay began to understand that without joining
        the fight the things they valued most would be destroyed. They gathered
        followers and showed them how to harness the powers of creation without
        devine aid, and mortals began to learn how to defend themselves. Whith
        the use of this new found knowledge of arcane magic they used it to
        drive away the tured creatoes and destroy the Primordials. For the first
        time the world was at peace and the first real civilization took root
        and was named Vasselheim "The Dawn City".

        Now that the mortals had a taste of magic and power they became
        audatious beleving that their arcane ablities gave proof that the Gods
        had no sway in their fate. They began studing magic in hopes to become
        as powerfull as the Gods. Many of these arcane practitioners progressed
        in their studdies evolving into powerfull such as Halas Lutagran or
        Vecna "The Whispered One". This power led to a curuption of greed
        conflict and naive ambition. A mage, whos name was purged from history,
        ceafted forbidden riets to challange The God of Death. In defeating him
        she took his place in the pantheon becoming the first mortal to obtain
        godhood. Archmage Vespin Chloras seeking a similar power sought guidence
        from The Betrayer Gods releasing them for his aid. It had been many
        years since The Betrayer Gods were imprisoned amognst many diffrent
        planes leaving the Gods anger and vengence to swell infecting their
        every thought. The emense hatered and rage blosumed into unspeakable
        horrors and creations beyond ones comprehention. They only wanted to see
        all instances of joy and peace irraticated leaving despair and suffering
        in their wake. The Gods found the world unscathed and well-preserved,
        that same vengence now morphed into a hunger to dominate once again.
        Turnning on Vespin making him a thrall, the Gods bore through their
        planes and into Exandria's. Seeking the remnants of their corrupt
        children they gathered in eastern Wildemont, on the plains of Xhorhas,
        and began their foreboding kingdom calling it Ghor Dranas.

        Like a beacon for lost souls mortals began gravitating to Ghor Dranas.
        The lords of darkness, infesting their minds, edaciously welcoming lost
        desolate souls with promises of great boons and immeaserable power.
        Their infectious offer spread like wild fire through the hearts of power
        obsessed mortals of the arcane.
