        Wildemount is an Exandrian continent located to the northeast of Tal'Dorei. The second campaign of Critical Role takes place on this continent. In the first 
        campaign, the Briarwoods originated from Wildemount before seizing Whitestone. Taryon Darrington and his family were also residents of Wildemount, and the 
        floating cities of Draconia had landed there.

          History

      <p>
        During the Age of Arcanum, there were approximately three major cities that utilized and had hoarded enough brumestone to be able to hold their entire cities aloft. 
        One of these floating cities crashed in Eiselcross in the Biting North, and the Dwendalian Empire is currently excavating what they can of that fallen empire, referred to as Aeor.
        Another such city was Zemniaz, from which grew the Zemnian language and the culture of the Empire itself. The final city to be held aloft by brumestones was Kethesk, 
        a shard of which came to rest in the Dreemoth Ravine where it was rebuilt into the city of Draconia, which lasted well into the modern age before it was destroyed by the Chroma Conclave.
        When the Betrayer Gods were released into Exandria, they and their followers founded a kingdom of their own, called Ghor Dranas, located in the region which would later become Xhorhas.
        The city of Rosohna was built on the ruins of Ghor Dranas. The battles of the Calamity horribly scarred much of Xhorhas, and brought down the floating cities of Aeor and Zemniaz. The Dwendalian 
        Empire slowly spread to encompass its neighbors, the peoples of the Zemni Fields, the Marrow Valley, and the Julous Dominion. With the Empire's victory in the Marrow War in about 545 P.D.,
        all of Western Wynandir came under control of the Empire.

      <b>Politics</b>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are ongoing continuous tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty, which broke out into full warfare in the War of Ash and Light in 835 through 836 P.D.
        Although a tenuous peace has been negotiated, hostility between the two countries remains high. For example, both are competing to recover artifacts and relics from the ruins of 
        the Age of Arcanum city of Aeor in Eiselcross, resulting in much mistrust and subtle skirmishes. The Clovis Concord, a loose confederation of eight independent city-states
        along the Menagerie Coast in the southwestern part of the continent, maintains a cordial relationship with the almost completely landlocked Empire. The Concord remained neutral during 
        the war between the Empire and the Dynasty. Virtually from the moment of its founding in 539 PD, the Dwendalian Empire sought to expand itself by absorbing or conquering its neighbors 
        in Western Wynandir. Inevitably, its continued expansion brought it up against the neighboring Kryn Dynasty. Although the Ashkeeper Peaks formed a natural boundary between the two, the 
        Kryn viewed the continuous expansion by the Empire with suspicion, while the Empire saw the Kryn as bestial remnants of a land devastated by the Calamity. Tensions grew between the two 
        countries, with continuing skirmishes and sometimes open battles occurring starting around 815 PD. In approximately 822-823 PD, a battle was fought near Nogvurot in which many soldiers 
        on both sides were killed. In the past few years, two of the precious Luxon beacons of the Dynasty had disappeared and resurfaced within the Empire. The Kryn believed they had been stolen, 
        while in reality they had been given to the Empire by a traitor within their own government, Shadowhand Essek Thelyss, who thought that the beacons should be studied rather than worshiped. 
        This exacerbated tensions between the two countries, and the Kryn eventually sent two infiltrators into Zadash in an unsuccessful attempt to recover at least one of the beacons, during which the 
        Zauber Spire was nearly destroyed. Instead, both Kryn were killed and the beacon disappeared, as it was recovered by the adventuring group known as the Mighty Nein. Martinet Ludinus Da'leth 
        listed the reasons for the tensions as: the Kryn belief in the Luxon, Kryn missionaries recently found in Nogvurot,[11] skirmishes along the border and the Kryn capture and torture of Empire 
        spies, rising numbers of Xhorhasian creatures crossing into the Empire, general mistrust of goblinoids, and a growing suspicion that the Kryn coveted the comparatively richer Empire lands. 
        On 3 Fessuran 835 PD, the simmering tensions boiled over into full-fledged war with a Kryn attack on the Ashguard Garrison in the Ashkeeper Peaks near the Brokenveil Marsh in which over 
        a thousand Empire soldiers were killed. In response, King Bertrand Dwendal formally declared war.

          War Between Xhorhas and the Dwendalian Empire

      <p>
        With news reaching Zadash that the advancing armies of the Kryn Empire had broken through The Ashguard Garrison at the Brokenveil Bluffs, the threat of the looming dark skies that accompanies 
        their armies grew. These dark clouds that hung over the Kryn lands to the east of the Ashkeeper Peaks had begun spreading from the east, and if left unchecked threatened to blot out the sun 
        from rising over the Dwendalian Empire. The war known as the War of Ash and Light was formally announced on 4 Fessuran 835.
